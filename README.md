Audio Frequency Comparison &amp; Voice Similarity Analysis uses FFT to convert audio signals into the frequency domain and compare their spectral features. It visualizes both recordings in a single graph and applies cosine similarity to generate a numerical score, enabling accurate voice and audio pattern comparison.
🎧 Audio Frequency Comparison & Voice Similarity Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing and comparing two audio recordings using frequency-domain signal processing techniques. The audio signals are transformed from the time domain to the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to extract meaningful frequency-based features.

The system evaluates important audio characteristics such as frequency distribution, intensity variation, and overall signal patterns. A combined frequency spectrum is generated to visually compare both recordings in a single graph.

To measure the similarity between the two audio samples, cosine similarity is applied to the extracted frequency features, producing a numerical similarity score. This score indicates how closely the two recordings match in terms of their spectral properties.

The project demonstrates the practical application of digital signal processing and voice analysis techniques for tasks such as speaker comparison, voice authentication, and audio pattern recognition.
